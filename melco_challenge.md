Your Presentation

The presentation should include the following:
● Problem Statement
● Value proposition/Business Impact
● Differentiation
● Operational Feasibility
● Core Technology/Architecture
● Team Profile

These are some guidelines and tips on how to create your proposal. The intent is to use it as a reference instead of a document to be rigorously followed, thus feel free to deviate or mix & match from the format presented. You may need more, less or entirely different slides depending on your idea.
