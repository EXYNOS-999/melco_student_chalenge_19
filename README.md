REDEFINING GUEST AND EMPLOYEE EXPERIENCES   As millennials are becoming the most represented age category of the world population, their influence on global consumption habits is also increasing, making the market go through profound changes to meet their needs and expectations.   For millennials, rather than owning tangible possessions, experiences and especially authentic experiences are more important - making traveling an essential aspect in this generationâ€™s lives and consequently influencing the hospitality and entertainment industry. Millennials are also more conscious about sustainability and our environmental impact and are therefore expecting businesses to take action in favor of the planet and to communicate on it.   To meet these expectations and be future-ready, Melco is looking for students innovators in the APAC region with ideas on how to implement new sustainable trends in the hospitality industry and reinvent guests' experiences.
